Ping is a utility used to test the connectivity between two networked devices or computers.
It sends a small data packet to the target device or computer and measures the time it takes
 for the packet to reach its destination and return back to the source.

Ping works by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets to the target device.
 These packets contain a unique identifier and a sequence number, along with some other data.
 When the target device receives the packet, it sends a response back to the source device with 
the same identifier and sequence number. The source device then measures the time it took for the
 packet to travel to the target device and back.

The ping utility is useful for diagnosing network connectivity issues, such as packet loss or high latency.
 If the target device does not respond to the ping request, it indicates that there may be a problem with the 
network connection between the devices. If the response time is high, it may indicate that there is a bottleneck 
or congestion in the network.

Ping is a simple and widely-used tool that can be used to quickly identify network connectivity issues.
 It is available on most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
