->Data Transmission(sending data divice to device)
	Data Encoding/decoding
	Transmission Medium (wired /wireless)
	Transmitter (that sends data)
	Reciver(as name)

->Packet Transmission(data as sets or packets/frames)
	data in small units
	Header Addidion(MetaData.src.destination,seq)
	Routing(Selecting path)
	Transmission(as Aboves)
	Reception(reciving data)
	Reassembly(packets to auctual data)


->Inter Networking(networking within Orginazition)


->Network Application(calsification of Network by design)
->OSI/TCP-IP Models

Classification of Network by(imp):
		Size(Lan,wan,man,san,wlan)
		Connectivity,(point to point network,BroadCast Network,Switched Networks)
		Communication Medium(wire,wireless)
		Mobility(Fixed Network(home wifi),Mobile Network(3g,4g,5g))
		Design(Client Side network(client->server, server->client),peer to peer (Direct Client to CLient or server to server))

Types of Multuplexing(trasnfer multiple through single mediam)
	FDM (freq division multiplexing(changing freq))
	WDM (wave // // (changing wave))
	TDM (time // //(Providing Time Period))

Media(a mean(thing) through data can travel)

Transmission media 
	copper glass air etc

Types of Media
	Guided 
		eg:copper optical coxial(tv cable wire)
	Un Guided
		eg:radio wave


Sync & Async Communication(same as programming concept)

Buad rate(speed at which data is transmitted through mediam) and farming error(occurs when reciver cant identify starting and ending of a packet or frame)

rs232(a standard used for communication espically in peer 2 peer)

Modulation(macking cahnge for encruption/decription(a Modem Device is a Moduler and DeModuler))
	Amplitude M
	Frequency M
	Phase M

Multiplexing(transfer 2 || more signal at a time single transmission medial by multiplexing || Modulation)

Packets(parts of data)
Why Packets(higher transfer rate,security)
Frames
Byte Stuffing(Editing Bytes to identify Proper data transmission)

(error handling)
	Parity Checking
	   Parity bit(added to byte for even and odd  )	
		Even parity(ensure that a byte has even bits of '1' )
		Odd Prity (ensures that a byte has odd bits of '1' )			Can only detect 1 bit error
	
	CheckSum
		Treat bits as integers add them (like 10101101=10101101+(5 in binary) and send to as data  )			

	Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC)(chatGPT)

6-->slide

16 bit CRC
types of error CRC could check
	Vertical error(Hardware failure damage 2nd b]it)
	Brust errors (cahnage in bit by lightning , electric motor start etc)

direct point to point Comunication
	Advantages
	Disadvantages
		Star topology(diadvantage tons of wires not itentifyable)

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

7-->Slide

Specifing destination in LAN(packets also have info of destination)
Hardware Adressing(packets have info in form of hardware addressing MAC Address)

LAN InterFace Checks these information and transmit data only to specified device also checks errore


Lan(Local area network)(chatGPT)

Lan Topologies(Star,Ring,Bus)
	eg of Bus
		Eithernet
			CSMA(Carieer Sense Multipe Access (Protocal used to avoid Collision b/w multiple Devices(Multiple users use eathernet at same time)))


///////////////////////////////////////////


9-->slide


Formate of hardware addressing 
	Numaric value
	Size selected for spefic network technelogy
	Lenght 1-6 bytes
	must be unique on lan
Problems with Brodcasting(sending data to each device connected)
	Use Computional Resources for both to use a frame or not
		Solution(Multicasting:Dosent send data directly to CPU , Interface Hardware deal wait data first(Checking address))





///////////////////////////////////////////


10-->slide

Multicasting(in it data is inly being sent to a group of specified hardware addresses istead of sending to all devices conected to a network)
Header and Frame Formats(
Frame Header= address and identifying information
information typically in fields with fixed size and location
Data Area my vary in size)

eg Data = preamble|dest Address|Source Address|Frame Type|Data|CRC|
		
		premable for syncronization of packets




IEEE 802.2 LLC(chatGPT)
