The business analyst role
The business analyst is the individual who has the primary responsibility to elicit, analyze, document,
and validate the needs of the project stakeholders. The analyst serves as the principal interpreter
through which requirements flow between the customer community and the software development
team, as shown in Figure 4-1. Many other communication pathways also are used, so the analyst
isn’t solely responsible for information exchange on the project. The BA plays a central role in
collecting and disseminating product information, whereas the project manager takes the lead in
communicating project information.
FIGURE 4-1 The business analyst bridges communication between customer and development stakeholders.
Business analyst is a project role, not necessarily a job title. Synonyms for business analyst include
requirements analyst, systems analyst, requirements engineer, requirements manager, application
analyst, business systems analyst, IT business analyst, and simply analyst. These job titles are used
inconsistently from organization to organization. One or more dedicated specialists could perform
the role on a given project or it could be assigned to team members who also perform other project
functions. These team members include project manager, product manager, product owner, subject
matter expert (SME), developer, and sometimes even user.
It’s important to note that when a person who has another project role also serves as the business
analyst, he is doing two distinct jobs. Consider a project manager who is also the BA on a project.
A project manager needs to create and manage plans, including schedules and resource needs, based
on work that BAs define. The project manager must help manage scope and deal with schedule
changes as scope evolves. He might perform the project management role one minute, then change
hats to execute the analyst practices the next. But these are distinct roles, requiring somewhat
different skill sets.
In organizations that develop consumer products, the analyst role is often the product manager’s
or marketing staff’s responsibility. Essentially, the product manager acts as a BA, often with additional
emphasis on understanding the market landscape and anticipating external users’ needs. If the
CHAPTER 4 The business analyst 63
project has both a product manager and a BA, typically the product manager focuses on the external
market and user demands, and the BA converts those into functional requirements.
Agile projects need business analysis skills, too. There will likely be a project role such as a product
owner who performs some of the traditional BA tasks. Some teams find it helpful to have someone in
an analyst role as well (Cohn 2010). The BA can help represent the users and understand their needs,
while performing the additional BA activities described later in the chapter. Regardless of the job title,
the person performing the analyst tasks must have the skills, knowledge, and personality to perform
the role well.
Trap Don’t assume that any talented developer or knowledgeable user can automatically
be an effective business analyst without training, resource materials, and coaching.
A talented analyst can make the difference between a project that succeeds and one that
struggles. One company discovered that they could inspect requirements specifications written by
experienced analysts twice as fast as those written by novices because they contained fewer defects.
In the popular Cocomo II model for project estimation, analyst experience and capability have a
great influence on a project’s effort and cost (Boehm et al. 2000). Using highly experienced analysts
can reduce the project’s overall effort by one-third compared to similar projects with inexperienced
analysts.



------------ > The business analyst role

In the provided text, let's analyze the role of a business analyst and the importance of their skills and experience:

The Role of a Business Analyst:
A business analyst is responsible for eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs of project stakeholders. They act as the primary communicator between the customer community and the software development team, bridging the gap in requirements understanding. The business analyst collects and disseminates product information, while the project manager focuses on communicating project-related information.

Job Titles and Responsibilities:
The job title of a business analyst can vary across organizations, including requirements analyst, systems analyst, requirements engineer, requirements manager, application analyst, business systems analyst, IT business analyst, and analyst. The role can be performed by dedicated specialists or team members with other project functions, such as project managers, product managers, developers, or subject matter experts (SMEs).

Distinction between Roles:
When a person holds both the project management and business analyst roles, they perform two distinct jobs that require different skill sets. A project manager creates and manages plans based on the work defined by the business analyst, managing scope and dealing with schedule changes. The business analyst focuses on eliciting requirements and performing analysis tasks.

Business Analysis in Different Contexts:
In organizations that develop consumer products, the role of the business analyst is often fulfilled by product managers or marketing staff. The product manager acts as a business analyst, understanding the market landscape and anticipating user needs, which the business analyst converts into functional requirements. In Agile projects, there may be a product owner who performs some traditional business analyst tasks, and having a separate business analyst can be beneficial.

Importance of Skills and Experience:
Effective business analysis requires specific skills, knowledge, and a suitable personality. It is important to recognize that not all talented developers or knowledgeable users can automatically be effective business analysts without training, resource materials, and coaching. Experienced analysts can significantly impact project success by producing requirements specifications with fewer defects, reducing overall effort and cost.

In conclusion, the role of a business analyst is crucial for understanding stakeholder needs, bridging communication gaps, and converting requirements into actionable information. Their skills, knowledge, and experience greatly influence project outcomes and success.

----------> The making of a business analyst

Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the information provided in the text:

1. Former User: Business analysts who previously worked on the business side as users of information systems have the advantage of understanding the business and work environment. They can easily gain the trust of their former colleagues and speak their language. However, they may lack knowledge of software engineering and struggle to communicate with technical people. They need to learn more about the technical side of software development and represent information in appropriate forms for different audiences.

2. Former Developer or Tester: Project managers sometimes assign developers or testers to perform the analyst role. While some developers may have the necessary skills and enjoy collaborating with customers, others may prefer working with code and lack patience with users. Testers, on the other hand, have an analytical mindset and are accustomed to thinking about exceptions and finding gaps in requirements. Both developers and testers need to learn about requirements engineering practices and, in the case of developers, gain more knowledge about the business domain.

3. Former (or Concurrent) Project Manager: Project managers who take on the business analyst role can leverage their skills in team coordination, communication, and understanding the organization and business domains. However, they need to shift their focus from timelines, resources, and budget constraints to understanding business needs and prioritizing them within project schedules. They must develop analysis, modeling, and interviewing skills that are essential for effective business analysis.

4. Subject Matter Expert (SME): Business analysts who are SMEs in the application domain bring valuable expertise to the role. They can assess requirements based on their experience, understand the impacts on users, and provide insights into system design and architecture. However, there is a risk that SMEs may prioritize requirements based on their own preferences rather than considering the needs of different user classes. They may also struggle to imagine the future system. Collaboration with a BA from the development team can help mitigate these risks.

5. Rookie: Becoming a business analyst can be an entry point into the IT industry for recent graduates or individuals transitioning from unrelated fields. They may possess the necessary skills but lack relevant experience and knowledge. These novice BAs need to learn the intricacies of requirements engineering practices and gain an understanding of the software development process. Mentoring plays a crucial role in helping them develop good habits and accelerate their learning curve.

In summary, regardless of their background, business analysts can enhance their effectiveness by filling knowledge and skill gaps, leveraging past experiences, and continuously practicing and refining their BA tasks. This holistic approach contributes to the growth and development of effective business analysts.
