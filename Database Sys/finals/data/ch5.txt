advantages of Relational Database Model:

	Data Integrity
	Data Independincy
	Structural Independency
	Data consistency & accuracy
	Data Retrival & Share


Keys:

	Super Key
	Candidate Key
	Primary Key
	Alternate Key
	Composite Key
	Foreign Key


Components of RDMS:

	File Manager
	Database Manager
	Query Processor(sql)
	Data Dictionary(Matadata)
	Database Manipuletion Language(DML) precompiler
	Data Defination Language(DDL)
	
	
Types of Relations

	Base Table(Main Table)
	Query Result Tables
	View(Spaefic Colums)

Advantages of Views:

	Security
	Query Simplicity
	Structural Simplicity(View as Prefered)
	Insulation Form Change
	

Proporties of Relations(Tables)
	All Elephants Use Tricky Insects Always,its amazing 

	Atomic Values in Fields
	Entries form Same Domain
	Unique Tuples
	Unique Attributes
	Insignificant Attribute Sequence
	Insignificant Tuple Sequence


Codd's Rules:
	
	1}The Information Rule(Data as Tables)
	2}The Guaranteed Access Rule(Data Must be accessible,table Name,Primary Key,Attribute Name)
	3}Systematic Treatment of NULL Values(NULL must exits != ' ', zero ,, indipendent of dataType(Any DataType could have NULL(Supports)))
	4}Active online Catalog based on the Relational Model(MetaData,Rules on Data,Constraints , Could Also be Accessed,mantained by DBMS)
	5}Comprehasive Data Sub-Language Rules(Data D,View D,Data Manipulation Rules,Constraints,Transactins Managament Operations)
	
	6}View Updating Rules(View(as Logical Table) could also be updatable)
	7}High Level Insert Update Delete(Multiple Tuple Manipulation)
	8}Physical Data Independance Rule(Change in Physical Layer Dosnt effect Logical layer)
	9}Logical Data Independance Rule(Change in Logical Layer Dosent Effect in External Layer)
	10}Integrity Independace Rules(Constraints Implemented in (database)Backend not in Application)
	11}Distribution Independance Rule(Distribution of DataBase on diff Loc Dosent effect Application)
	12}Non-Subversion Rule(constraints Should be on DBMS so that Security Cant be bypassed )


Relational Data Integrity:
	
	Entity Integrity(each row has primary key !=NULL (ti identify each row))
	Domain Integrity(Spefic range of data entered in a column)
	Referential Integrity(Preserves Relation b/w tables when records are added or edited or deleted)


Database Languages:
	2 types
	DDL(DataDefination Language)
	DML(DataManepulation Language)
		Prociderual DML
		Non Procedural DML


Join(connect two or more tables to get data from one tuple of relation with other tuple of same or other relation:::(relations must have comman attribute)):

	Theta Join(Selected Rows of first relation marged with all rows of second relation donated= R[X]S)
	Equi Join(Tuples are joined on the basics of comman attribute (commanly used) same attributes appears twice in output :: FACULTY |X| Facality.FacID=COURCES.FID^COURSE)
	
	Natural Join(Same as Equi Join but return comman Attribute once in Some Systems may require same attribute name or a renaming mechanisum::FACULITY|X|FacID,FID^COURSE)

	Outer Join()
		left outer joined
		right outer joined
		full outer join
	semi join
